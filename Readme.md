### Deployed - Kovan Testnet (beta release only)

## Thought Process

- Original flash loan idea was to create a cross-exchange arbitrage bot, inspired by [Julien Klepatch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienklepatch) from [Eat the Blocks](https://www.youtube.com/eattheblocks).
- Week 2/3 changed directions and decided on an open source liquidation bot driven by Aave [hack ideas](https://docs.aave.com/hack/ideas).

## Lessons Learned
- Working across timezones is challenging and being in the same timezone helps tremendously with communication and productivity. 

- Best to make clear what are everyone's goals, availability, and committment from the start ensures unnecessary suprises later on.

- When deciding what to build, as a team agree on a few key metrics and that will help you to stay on track and build faster. 

- Be honest and upfront about your skills so that everyone is clear on their responsibility. 

- Take advantage of all hackathon resources, which includes workshops, sponsors, and mentors to get unstuck fast.
